Easily display GraphicRiver items inside WordPress widget.

== Description ==

A simple WordPress plugin that fetches information from the Envato API and displays GraphicRiver items as a WordPress widget.

This is a fork of the [Meks ThemeForest Smart Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meks-themeforest-smart-widget/)
We have just modified it to fetch the information from graphicriver instead of themeforest, removed sorting by item popularity, and replaced the categories to be output. All code is written by the awesome team at MeksHQ that creates the most amazing WordPress themes and if you have any issues with the functionality/compatibility of the plugin, please refer to their support page.

If you are a CodeCanyon author this widget is perfect for you.
